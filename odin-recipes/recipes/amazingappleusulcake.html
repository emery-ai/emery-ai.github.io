                <li>340 grams Butter Smoothie</li>
                <li>540 grams ground Sugar Coated Leaf</li>

            <h1>To Make the Cake:</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Spray two 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray, line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper, and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk the Wheat Flour, Orange Drink Powder, and Sprinkling of Salt together until well combined. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl or measuring cup, whisk the Week Old Glass of Milk, Lost Desert Sandy Olive Oil, and Pumpkin Spice Coffee together until well combined. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large mixing bowl using a handheld mixer, beat the Butter Smoothie on low speed until smooth, then slowly mix in the Bag of Sugar.</li>
                <li>Once all of the sugar is added, increase to medium speed and continue mixing for another 4 to 5 minutes or until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Mix in the Yellow Draik Eggs, one at a time, making sure to stop and scrape around the bottom and sides of the bowl after each Egg.</li>
                <li>Add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the Week Old Glass of Milk mixture (begin and end with the dry ingredients) on low speed. Mix in each addition until just combined, making sure not to over mix the batter.</li>
                <li>Fold in the chopped Dewy Apples and use a rubber spatula to scrape around the bottom and sides of the bowl to ensure that everything is well combined.</li>
                <li>Evenly divide the cake batter between the two prepared cake pans and spread it around into one even layer.</li>
                <li>Bake for 28 to 32 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pans for about 20 minutes. Slide a knife around the outside of the cakes, then carefully remove the cakes from the pans, and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>To Make the Icing:</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large mixing bowl using a handheld mixer, beat the Butter Smoothie on medium speed until smooth.</li>
                <li>Mix in the ground Sugar Coated Leaf on low speed, one cup at a time, making sure to mix well after each addition.</li>
                <li>Add the Harffel Flavoured Milk and Sprinkling of Salt and mix on low-medium speed until fully combined, making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h1>To Assemble the Cake:</h1>
                <li>Level the tops of each cake with a knife or cake leveler. Place one of the cakes on a cake stand, top with a layer of icing, and smooth it out into one even layer. Place the second layer on top, then use the remaining frosting to ice the top and sides of the cake.</li>
